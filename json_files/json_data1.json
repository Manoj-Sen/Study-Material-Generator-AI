  "Working Principle": {
    "point": "The working principle of Ohm's Law is based on the behavior of electrons in a conductor. When a voltage is applied across a conductor, it creates an electric field that exerts a force on the electrons, causing them to move. The flow of electrons constitutes an electric current. The resistance of the conductor hinders the flow of electrons, and the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance is described by Ohm's Law: V = IR.",

  "Proof of Law": {
    "point": "Ohm's Law can be mathematically derived from more fundamental principles in electrical engineering, such as Ohm's Law for a small element of a conductor and Kirchhoff's Laws. The proof of Ohm's Law involves analyzing the behavior of electrons, the energy transfer in an electric field, and the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit.",
